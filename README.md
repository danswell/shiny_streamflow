# shiny_streamflow
A shiny app for exploring the streamflow data of the ACT

### Introduction

21 December 2020

First iteration of the app pushed to shinyapps.io

7 May 2020

Update: Project execution moved to rstudio.cloud. This is a web-hosted rstudio environment that links seemlessly with github. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF RSTUDIO!

This app is based heavily on my previous app, ACT Rainfall explorer. The concept is the same:

* an imbedded historical dataset is loaded
* latest data is pulled from the ACT Government Open data portal and apended
* Metadata is pulled from the ACT Government Open data portal
* UI and Server functions to select and plot data, download etc.
