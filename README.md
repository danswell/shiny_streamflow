# shiny_streamflow
A shiny app for exploring the streamflow data of the ACT

### Introduction

3 April 2020

This app is based heavily on my previous app, ACT Rainfall explorer. The concept is the same:

* an imbedded historical dataset is loaded
* latest data is pulled from the ACT Government Open data portal and apended
* Metadata is pulled from the ACT Government Open data portal
* UI and Server functions to select and plot data, download etc.
